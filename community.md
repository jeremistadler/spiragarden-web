## Guidelines

While there are many many interesting government-related projects, we are limiting the list above to [GitHub organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) with projects on GitHub, who are:

* Official government institutions, listed under their country or level of government
* Non-profits or groups focused on government, listed under "Civic Hackers"

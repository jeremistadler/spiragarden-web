### Under the Hood

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open source static site generator. This means the Jekyll program takes the content we want to be on the site and turns them into HTML files ready to be hosted somewhere. Awesomely, GitHub provides free web hosting for repositories, called [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and that's how this site is hosted.
